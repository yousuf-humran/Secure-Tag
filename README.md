# RFID Access Control System

**RFID Access Control System** is a lightweight, real-time access control solution built using the Arduino Nano, RDM6300 RFID Reader (125kHz), and ST7735 TFT Display. It scans RFID tags and displays access status through a user-friendly graphical interface. This project is suitable for prototype-level security, educational demonstrations, or basic access control systems.

## âœ… System Workflow

1. **Startup:**
   - On power-up, the TFT screen displays:
     ```
     Booting...
     Welcome
     RFID Scanner
     ```

2. **Ready State:**
   - After 3 seconds, the screen shows:
     ```
     Scan RFID...
     ```

3. **RFID Scan & Authentication:**
   - When an RFID tag is scanned:
     - ðŸ”“ **If Authorized**:
       ```
       Access
       GRANTED
       ```
       (Displayed in **green**)

     - ðŸ”’ **If Unauthorized**:
       ```
       Access
       DENIED
       ```
       (Displayed in **red**)

4. **Reset:**
   - After 2 seconds, the screen returns to:
     ```
     Scan RFID...
     ```

## Configuring Authorized Tags

You can customize the authorized tag list in the `.ino` file by modifying this section:
> ```cpp
> long allowed_tags[] = {669262, 379461, 372014, 740380};
> ```

## Library Dependencies

The following libraries are required to compile and run the project:

1. **SoftwareSerial**  
   - Used for communication with the RFID module via software serial ports.
   
2. **Adafruit GFX Library**  
   - Provides graphics primitives for drawing shapes, text, and images on TFT displays.

3. **Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789**  
   - Enables support for ST7735 and ST7789-based TFT displays.

4. **SPI**  
   - Provides support for SPI communication, essential for interfacing with the TFT display.

### Installation Instructions

1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Navigate to:  
   `Sketch â†’ Include Library â†’ Manage Libraries...`
3. In the Library Manager, search for and install the following:
   - **Adafruit GFX Library**
   - **Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library**
   - **Adafruit BusIO**

> The **SoftwareSerial** library is bundled with the Arduino AVR boards core and does not require separate installation.
